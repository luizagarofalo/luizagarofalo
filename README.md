## Hello there!

I'm a Senior iOS Developer with over 7 years of working experience building high-quality mobile applications. I specialize in Swift, UIKit, and SwiftUI, and I'm passionate about scalable architecture, code quality, and delivering outstanding user experiences.

Throughout my career, I've contributed to consumer-facing and financial apps at scale, collaborating closely with cross-functional teams in agile environments. I also have experience as a Tech Lead for iOS projects, mentoring developers and helping maintain high engineering standards through architecture decisions, code quality improvements, and team collaboration.

I'm skilled in refactoring legacy codebases, implementing automated testing, and setting up efficient CI/CD pipelines. I'm always seeking opportunities to learn, grow, and work with innovative technologies.

I'm looking for teams with a strong engineering culture, where collaboration, innovation, and technical excellence are valued.
