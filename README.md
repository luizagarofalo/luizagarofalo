## Hello, there!

I'm an iOS Developer with more than five years of working experience developing mobile applications with its best practices: pair programming, code reviewing, refactoring old code base, test coverage with unit tests, troubleshooting and debugging. I also have a lot of experience with financial products, having worked for large companies in the sector. 

I've been looking for companies that have a strong engineer culture, that would provide me the opportunity to use new technologies and to work with people from different cultures.

* I'm really into photography, dog training and coffee brewing.
